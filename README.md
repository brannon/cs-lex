CsLex is a derivative of the JLex implementation by Elliot Joel Berk and C. Scott Ananian.
The design and architecture of CsLex, written in C#, is based on a melding of the JLex implementation and the Lex functional specification. JLex was written for the Java language, and it's direct antecedent Lex, designed and written for the C language.

CsLex distinguishes itself by incorporating a number of C# language constructs and services; refer to the design notes for CsLex for more details on C# specific features incorporated into the CsLex design.
